# Program 4: math operators

# addition
print(2 + 2)

# subtraction
print(2 - 5)

# multiplication
print(8 * 5)

# division
print (10 / 2) # division always outputs a float
print(5 / 25)

# integer division (floor division)
print(2 / 3) # always produces an integer; if necessary, rounds floats down to an integer
print(8 / 4)

# exponentiation
print(2 ** 6)

# exponentiation w/ floats
print(2 ** 2.5) # also always a float

# modulus (division remainder)
print(2 % 3) # 3 does not fit into 2, so the output is 2
a = 45321887724139
print(a % 2) # something mod 2 can easily determine oddness where 1 is odd and 0 is even
